# Baryar Transportation & Logistics Platform - Feature Implementation Roadmap (V6)

Canonical product feature list for **Baryar (Taticom Ecosystem)**
freight and logistics. Source of truth for *what* to build:
`resources/RFP.pdf` (16 pages, published 10 Shahrivar 1405). This file is
the implementation checklist derived from that RFP. Contractor process
(SOW, bidding, contracts, NDA) stays in the PDF and is not duplicated here.

Phase 1 is the booking MVP (cargo owner + driver + admin oversight).
Phase 2 stays parked until Phase 1 booking works: live GPS, companies/fleet,
ratings, payments, KYC APIs, Telegram/WhatsApp, SMS gateway, BI.

Each row mentions exactly **one single feature** without combining multiple functionalities to provide absolute clarity for development [14, 15].
